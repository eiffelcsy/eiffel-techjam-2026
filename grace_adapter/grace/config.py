"""YAML <-> dataclass config, mirroring `pipeline.config`.

Three kinds of config, one directory each:

    configs/cache/<name>.yaml       what to render, for which detector
    configs/train/<name>.yaml       one stage-1 or stage-2 run against a cache
    configs/detectors/<name>.yaml   the ADAPTED detector, in the harness's shape

Detectors and datasets are never redefined here: a cache config references the
harness's own `configs/detectors/*.yaml` and `configs/datasets/*.yaml` by path,
so each is described in exactly one place in the project and GRACE cannot drift
from what was benchmarked.

Absent keys fall through to the dataclass defaults rather than being restated, so
there is one place a default is written down. `configs/defaults.yaml` is the
annotated reference and is never loaded.
